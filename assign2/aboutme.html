    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>
    Hello, my name is AJay, and I am a fourth-year student at RGM. 
I have always had a passion for writing and storytelling. Still, it wasn’t until 
the junior year that I began to take it seriously. In the past year or so, my writing has become more refined and polished.
 I have been able to apply what I’ve learned in school to help me write more effectively and convey my ideas more clearly.

My goal is to eventually be able to write professionally and publish fiction novels in the future.
